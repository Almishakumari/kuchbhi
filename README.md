This project applies multiple image-processing effects to a single image of the Taj Mahal. The goal is to show how different filters can transform an image and how fast each operation runs. The work was done in Google Colab using Python and OpenCV.
The program loads one image and applies several processing techniques:
Strong Gaussian Blur
Canny Edge Detection
Bilateral Smoothing
Sharpening
Color Quantization (Posterize)
Emboss Filter
Grayscale Conversion
Color Inversion

The results are displayed in a 3×3 grid along with the processing time for each filter.

in output the original tajmahal and output processed imahe of taj mahal is shown
